Kingfishers are a family of small to medium-sized, often brightly colored birds (family Alcedinidae) known for their large heads, long, sharp, pointed bills, and expert fish-hunting abilities. They are found worldwide (except Antarctica) near rivers, lakes, and coastal areas, often diving from perches to catch fish, insects, and small crustaceans
